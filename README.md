# Rails form_tag Lab

## Objectives

1. Build a functional Rails form using a `form_tag`

2. Pass a route helper as the argument to a `form_tag`

3. Pass an options hash with a method to a `form_tag`

4. Use a `text_field_tag` and other form controls to create inputs

5. Build a `new` action that renders a form that submits to the `create` action

## Instructions

The two specs for this lab that are currently failing are located within the
`form page` feature in `specs/features/student_spec.rb`.

For this lab, you need to build a form to create a new student, have the form
redirect _back_ to the `new` view template (commonly, a `create` action would
redirect to `index`), and print out the form params to the screen. Below are a
few items to keep in mind:

- Draw a `new` and `create` route for the `students` resource

- Print out the student value to the view template page

## Keys to remember

- Look at the tests to see which field values you should be using

- Make sure to use the `form_tag` helpers
